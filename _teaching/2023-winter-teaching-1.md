The beginning of my teaching career. I only had around 48 hours to prepare myself to teach in this semester. I don't know if I did a good job as a teacher, but I tried my very best to carry out my duties as responsibly as I could. As someone with little to no pedagogical experience, my rule of thumb was to be like a teacher that I wish I had back when I was a student.
