Camus provides callbacks to the works of Søren Kierkegaard, Arthur Schopenhauer, and Friedrich Nietzsche throughout the entire essay — and sadly I am not too well familiar with the works of the aforementioned philosophers (Hopefully, I'll read their works in the future, insha'Allah). Nonetheless, Camus' argument for the absurdity and meaninglessness of existence was something worth studying, and I wanted to explore this side of the philosophy realm for quite some time. The last two (quite elegant) lines of the essay concurs well with a realization that I have had for while, which is that true happiness comes from seeing yourself struggling towards a valued goal.
