Neil deGrasse Tyson was making the rounds in the late-night comedy shows promoting this book back then. The quasi-nihilistic CSE-fresher me decided that it would be a good idea to read yet another astrophysics book ('cause, why not?) instead of focusing on academics. It was a nice read nonetheless.
