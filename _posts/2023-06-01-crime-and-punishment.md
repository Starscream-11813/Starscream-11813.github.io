It's a widely-held opinion that *Crime and Punishment* is the best novel ever written. This was a challenging read, I must say â€” especially keeping track of the character names. The key takeaway for me was the realization of the fact that the temptations laid open to Raskolnikov would be more at hand for a person that truly doesn't believe in a God by faith (at least that's what I think for now). The exposition of the pathological aspects of radical rationality and nihilism were ineffably portrayed by Dostoevsky. I don't know whether this is his *magnum opus* or not, and I wish to read his other works when I find the time. This book, however, was a good stepping stone into the realm of Russian literature.
