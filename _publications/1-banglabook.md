<u>Abstract:</u> The analysis of consumer sentiment, as expressed through reviews, can provide a wealth
of insight regarding the quality of a product. While the study of sentiment analysis
has been widely explored in many popular
languages, relatively less attention has been
given to the Bangla language, mostly due
to a lack of relevant data and cross-domain
adaptability. To address this limitation, we
present <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">BanglaBook</span>, a large-scale dataset
of Bangla book reviews consisting of 158,065
samples classified into three broad categories:
positive, negative, and neutral. We provide a
detailed statistical analysis of the dataset and
employ a range of machine learning models
to establish baselines including SVM, LSTM,
and Bangla-BERT. Our findings demonstrate
a substantial performance advantage of pretrained models over models that rely on manually crafted features, emphasizing the necessity for additional training resources in this domain. Additionally, we conduct an in-depth
error analysis by examining sentiment unigrams, which may provide insight into common classification errors in under-resourced
languages like Bangla.
